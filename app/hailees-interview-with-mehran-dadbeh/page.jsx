            Hello Mehran, <br />
Thank you for allowing me to interview you for The Big Smoke. <br /> I have
some questions below that I would love to ask you. Please let me
know if any of them need clarification. <br />
What made you start sharing about breakups on YouTube?
          </p>

            Mehran:    
            </b>
             Every
time my son broke up with his girlfriend I knew what he must be
feeling and how painful the experience must be as I still
remembered how it felt for me when I was younger and would
go through a break up or relationship challenges and concerns,
how terrible the whole experience felt and how deep in
the psyche it would affect one and that this was not limited to a
certain age and was a horrible feeling no matter at what age this
would happen! :) <br /> <br />
Whether it was experienced in high school (the "poppy love"
stage) or in university with more serious loves and
relationships. <br /> I wanted nothing more than being able to help
clear and make some sense of it all for him. When he told me
about his break up and how he felt and the emotional challenge
of it, we discussed the angles of the experience of break up and
the thought process that goes with it, challenges, the quality of
the emotions and feelings involved. <br /> <br /> Why it feels the way it does
after a break up and how to translate it and deal with it’s effects
on our day to day mood, our focus on how relationships move in
the field of life and so on…. <br /> <br />
Our talks made him feel much better and the discussion helped
open new understanding and brought about more tolerance
during the post break up and the moving on process. <br /> <br />
So I decided to share the points, angles and the discussion we
had on YouTube as I felt there must be millions of younger,
young or more mature men and women going through
similar emotionally difficult times around the world knowing that
this is not limited to any certain age of people regardless of
where they come from or what language they speak,
cultural customs they follow or what they do, as love,
relationship and emotional challenge is a universal experience
which happens to tango with or enlighten any and every one of
us at any age, colour, race, stature or stage in life.

            This is
one of the few things in life that is totally universal among us all
earthlings and it makes us feel in the very same way in almost
every way regardless of our age, economic strength, might or
stature, upbringing, family or social hierarchy, political
inclination, culture, colour, race or gender. <br /> <br /> We all feel the pain
the same and we all have the same questions, puzzled by the
same maneuvers in a relationship break up stage and want
answers about the same questions and concerns.

            They
all want to know why what happened, happened, how could
such a thing happen, what does it mean to them, how does it
reflect or alter the quality of their character how it affects their
self worth and how they can repair damages to their confidence
level , how to get their confidence back, if the break up means
that they are not good enough and if whomever the ex is now
with after leaving them is better than them and why the ex left,
were they not good enough, how they can get her/him back.
<br /> <br />
They all want to know what has caused it , why she /he suddenly
left or why the break up did take place at all and why can’t they
move on and how can they move on, how they can delete their
memories of the ex, how not to think of her/him and how they
can go on and why they miss the ex ( even though they agree
that the relationship was not meeting their expectation ) and
why they are hurting and how they can stop the pain, would they
fall in love again, how to move on faster, how long this pain will
last and…...

happening within our psyche and how can understanding that help us
to learn about what went right and wrong in our relationships and how

            We are
engaged in a relationship with the image of the partner we have
created in our mind and the image of our own self that we have
created in our mind and she is having a similar set up in her
own consciousness (an image of us in her mind having a
relationship with an image she has of herself in her mind). <br /> <br />
These images are the ones having a relationship with each
other and not us as the actual individual and so obviously the
whole relationship in most part is with an illusion, an image of
the other and our own that has no exact actuality to it and due to
the complete differences in the make up of our consciousness
from each other there will always be a division in the order we
each have created hence the conflict is inevitable. <br /> <br />By
understanding the role of the consciousness according to it’s
conditioning and how desire, ego and fear interact with the
quality of the relationship we will have a grasp of the “whys”
and therefore we will be able to understand the role of fears,
desire and the illusion of psychological security in the break up,
and to bring answers to the puzzling questions about the
reasons and the movement of the breakups and regain our
confidence and move on wiser and better equipped to make a
better success out of the next experience we will encounter
after this breakup!

            Online communities have emerged to offer support and guidance to
each other during the emotional roller coaster, that is break ups. <br /> <br />Why
do you think that people are turning to online forums such as
YouTube for guidance? <br />And how do you see your role in this?
          </p>

            Mehran:

            Most
do not know what they should do, more specifically said “how
they should think” and how they may find a remedy for their
emotional pain. <br /> <br /> People are used to quick answers to their pains
and questions. Internet is at their fingertips service and very
inexpensive to find remedy to their discomfort. <br /> <br />
They are also clear on the fact that this what they are feeling
must have been felt by some others as we are all of the
same species and sharing same responses to misfortune and
loss of loved ones ( physically or emotionally), so they trust that
some one else has already gone through this and has found
experiences that could help them in their ordeal. <br /> <br />
Often the advise they get on internet sites or on YouTube
programs are in capsule forms or in short sentences or
explanations which seems helpful on the surface but since
there are no logic or in-depth understanding of the role of their
own psyche in this and how the whole consciousness, fears,
desire, ego are in play and how they each interact and affect the
other, they are left with an incomplete understanding of what
goes on and how they feel and why, and fall back into the no
man’s land as far as why they are feeling the way they do and
not clear in how to see it coming next time or how to understand
the reasoning behind their questions and concerns, despair,
fears, depression, low mode, lack of hope and unhappiness. <br /> <br />
I believe if I want to help some one from hunger then best to
give him the whole sandwich than just a bite and then have him
come for another byte later on and so on and charge for every
byte! :) <br /> <br />
I like to give them the whole mechanism of their
machine, their psyche, help them to understand the scenario,
the subject of question in their mind and clarify the “whys” as
much as possible in longer videos and then if they wish to talk
to me on a one on one Skype consultation or purchase one of
my e-books from Amazon or my own site 
<a className='text-blue-500' href="www.mindthatseekstruth.com"> www.mindthatseekstruth.com </a> 
 then they will make that decision
after their hunger is satisfied and can think clearly rather than
act as the result of being desperate and from extreme hunger to
buy something while still unable to focus to know what and why
they want to know more and what is it that they need to know. <br /> <br />
I am passionate about what I am doing and I am equipped to
deliver to them the manual of the machine that they have been
operating but never knew how it is put together and what are
the elements that fuels it, steers it, affects it’s functions,
performance, power and mode and help them to know that the
capability of this machine of theirs. <br /> <br />To help them to learn about
their mind, their psyche, how they are wired together,
conditioned and what makes the whole mechanism of their
machine function, should they want to know that is. <br /> <br />
In addition to this approach I have for the past 12 weeks started
a program of holding live talks on FB and have a chance to
share the discussions on the understanding of this manual live
with thousands around the world where they can ask their
questions and I would respond to their situations live and others
could also listen and benefit from each answer till they get their
own turn and ask their question when I get to it. <br /> <br />
Now this is an opportunity for thousands of people around the
world who can not afford the $150 Cad per hour one on one
Skype consultation with me or their time does not coordinate
with the available time schedule during the week and instead
they can pay a nominal fee of $2 and get a chance to hear
answers to many many questions in relation to a break up and
emotional relationship hardship and most probably get their
questions read and answered while on air live. <br /> <br />
This makes it an affordable service and available every week
and accessible to all and if they still needed a one on one
private consultation then they will have more time and patience
to make that additional arrangement should it still be necessary. <br /> <br />
This probably is most efficient and most unselfish economically
driven style of helping people specially the young men and
women around the world.
Fast affordable and accessible to all.

experience or can they be a blessing in disguise?

            Almost always it
is a blessing in disguise, a chance to enlightenment, further
development, to become wiser and more worldly and certainly a
gateway to more wisdom and power to withstand the challenges
of the future in the making! <br /> <br />
If used properly and learn from it wisely, it will serve as
greatest catapult to propel one to overcome obstacles and
become better at interaction with life and paves the road to
better and happier times in life. :)

            Often the recommendation after a break up is to have No contact with
your ex for the purpose of breaking the intrusive and sometimes
destructive thought patterns that can occur causing us emotional
pain. What are your thoughts on the No contact 'rule'?
          </p>

          <p className='text-gray-800 py-4 text-lg whitespace-pre-wrap break-words'>
            <b className='pr-4 text-2xl'>
            Mehran:
            </b>
            No contact
rule is an obvious policy to adopt to create this necessary space
for both to relax and find their path and re-assess their objective
of where they want to go and where they are but this is not
going to help clarify anything, its like saying lets stop stirring or
agitate or shake the bucket with mud in it for a while so it will
separate from the water and the mud settles. <br /> <br /> But after such
peaceful time of no agitation the mud is still in the bucket and
the mud has not been cleared by simply not shaking the bucket
any more! :) <br /> <br />
What needs to be done is to take this seriously and want to find
out why I am thinking the way I do, why I am hurting, what is
hurting, what is the role of my thoughts in this, why do I think in
this way and where does my thoughts come from ? How do they
form and why does it affect me as it does, why do I still want the
girlfriend/ boyfriend after this bitter break up? Why do I miss
her/him? What is the process that makes me feel this way and
what are the affects of my conditioning on the whole thing, what
does fear have anything to do with my emotional pain, what
about desire and how is desire born and why do I desire this girl
or this boy or .....
<br /> <br />
These are what makes the mind become knowledgeable about
the whole thing and knows then how to think and no longer be
affected so badly and soon become free from the pain because
he or she now understand the elements in the works and no
longer easily manipulated by the ego, desire, thoughts,
consciousness, the conditioning and the whole concept of value
and worthiness both for him/herself and for the partner.

            Often people seek closure after a break up and feel that they must
have answers in order to move on. In your experience, can closure
always be obtained and is it mandatory in order to heal the heartache
and move forward?
          </p>

          <p className='text-gray-800 py-4 text-lg whitespace-pre-wrap break-words'>

            Mehran:
            </b>
            Closure often can be achieved by a simple communication and
recap the relationship in a civilized and cordial manner but it is
not necessary in all cases as closure in most cases means that
you are expecting justice from the one who has actually initiated
the injustice!
Well if he or she knew better then they would not commit to this
injustice or the hurt that the break up has caused. <br /> <br /> It’s like
asking me to apologize for a decision that I have made where I
could have perfectly well chosen not to make that decision but I
did. <br /> <br /> Well if I have made that decision then it means I believe in
that decision and believe that decision serves me well so how
can I now say I am sorry about making this decision and be
truthful about it. <br /> <br />
Why should a closure be dependent on the agreement of the
one who has chosen to break up?
Why can’t it be on the basis of truth and facts and not
dependent on another human being to declare or affirm it in one
way or another?
No one is superior to the other to ask for his or her approval of
some facts during the time of the relationship or how this one or
that partner behaved.... and seek approval in order to have
closure. <br /> <br /> Who can be better than you yourself and the truth to
give you immediate closure and why would the opinion of the
partner be more effective or important than the facts and the
truth regardless of who knows it or not?
Why can’t we have a relationship with the truth and facts of the
relationship and have no need for any closure from the other
side. <br /> <br />
We are conditioned to seek approval from others as we have
been programmed since childhood by the society that we are
not good enough and in order to know how we are we must
have some one’s approval and this some one himself/ herself
needs approval from some one else in order to feel good about
him/herself. <br /> <br />
Closure is not in the hands of another person to hand it out and
it is much simpler than that. <br /> <br /> It is within the pages of the truth &
facts and that is all needed for feeling ok after a break up.

            It is not the end of the world, life
can not be summed up in one woman/ man or one relationship,
life has lot more to offer than you can imagine let alone one
partner who does not want you! <br /> <br />
No one is a god and they all have the same needs and
shortcomings so believe in yourself that you are no less than
any one else (with whom you were in a relationship) and focus
on what was it that the ex was providing which has made
her/him so desired?
When you focus on it you will see that if you did not know this
person all then what you are missing right now could have be
provided and is available through millions of others if you chose
to have a relationship with and spend enough time to get to
know each other and create the same psychological security
that you seem to be missing now and think that it was only
available through the ex. <br /> <br />
Whatever this relationship was you were the creator of it and
given another opportunity who would meet your basic
standards and requirement in a potential partner, you can create
another relationship just as warm and wonderful if not better (
due to your added wisdom and experience from this past one)
again as without you, whatever this ex was could not have
become what he/she had become, it was you who made that
person as good as he/she seems to be now, it is your thoughts
that have given such echelon or importance/ value to this ex
and it was not all him/her alone. <br /> <br /> So now go and build it with
another one as you are the main ingredient in this, you were and
can again and again be the architect and build a better one! <br /><br />
Use this knowledge / experience and choose better next time! :)
